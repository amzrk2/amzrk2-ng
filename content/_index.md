## This site

### Compatibility

This site is built based on the latest version of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/), so please raise an [issue](https://github.com/dsrkafuu/dsr-ca/issues) if you are having problems with other browsers. Outdated browsers such as IE will not be supported.

Also, as the site is already using [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) images across the board without fallbacks, only Safari 14+ on iOS 14+ and macOS 11+ will be supported.

### Intention

In late 2019, I wrote a new Hugo theme [Fuji](https://github.com/dsrkafuu/hugo-theme-fuji) for myself to use on my personal blog. From then until the end of the year, I gradually built up my notes to keep track of my learning progress.

After seeing that the my blogs and notes were spread across different services and platforms and became cumbersome to maintain, I came up with the idea of a consolidated site. For ease of deployment, SEO optimization, and deconstruction of static articles as the main content, I decided to use the familiar Hugo framework to build a more intuitive web interface.
